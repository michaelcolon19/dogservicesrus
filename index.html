          <h2>How Dog Walking Helps Keep Your Dog Sane</h2>
          <h5>Jan 21, 2021</h5>
          <p>
            We are a nation that loves to spoil our pets. Americans spend around $61 billion a year on our pets, and many dog owners are
            happy to spend generously on gourmet dog food, expensive treats and toys. But some of those same pet owners may be depriving
            their dogs of the essential things they need to be healthy and happy.
          </p>

          <h2>Healthy Pet Treats</h2>
          <h5>May 22, 2017</h5>
          <p>
            Consider healthy pet treats you can make at home instead of store-bought ones. It's easy, healthy, and less expensive than store-bought treats such as Petco and Petsmart, the two 
            largest retailers of pet supplies in the US. Both announced this week that they would stop selling pet treats made in China because of persistent 
            concerns that they are making pets sick. Since 2007, the FDA has issued several warnings about these products, although no specific cause for illness has been identified.

          <h2>Summer Pet Safety: Don’t Leave Your Pets in a Parked Car</h2>
          <h5>Jul 3, 2017</h5>
          <p>
            Summer, one of the glories of living in the Southeast, is finally here bringing warmer days and sunny skies. Because we’re used to hot summers in
            this part of the country, we don’t think as much about the dangers summer heat can present to our pets. We tend to forget that most of our pets come supplied
              with a fur coat and can’t sweat to lower their body heat. They rely on panting as the primary way to cool off, so they are much more subesquent to the effects of hot weather 
              than we humans are normally.
